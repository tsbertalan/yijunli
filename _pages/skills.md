Statistical genetics analysis for complex traits (e.g., GWAS, PRS, statistical fine-mapping, colocalization, Mendelian randomization, QTL mapping, etc.) 
<br>
Analysis for high-dimensional molecular data (e.g., EWAS, differential expression analysis using bulk RNA-sequencing data, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), similarity network fusion (SNF), etc.)
<br>
Other analysis including pathway enrichment analysis, gene-by-environment interactions, etc.
