Led an analysis in a cohort of children with chronic kidney disease and found that short stature was associated with faster time to reduced kidney function (eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) after kidney transplantation. 
- Performed non-parametric survival analysis (log-rank test) and model the cumulative incidence using parametric survival models (conventional log-normal distribution).
- Propensity score weighting was used to account for potential confounding.\
