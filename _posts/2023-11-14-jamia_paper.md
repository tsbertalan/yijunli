Conducted data analysis to evaluate the quality of time series physiologic signals in a large-scale ICU database. 
- Evaluated the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of minute-by-minute time series vital signs data, including heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and arterial blood pressure, captured from 16,009 patients-ICU stays and corresponding to 9410 unique adult patients.
- This study has paved the way for the future development of predictive models for ICU outcomes utilizing this extensive database.
