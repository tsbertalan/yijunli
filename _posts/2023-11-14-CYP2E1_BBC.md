Led an analysis to discover the associations between acetaminophen metabolites (measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, LC-MS) in cord blood and lower DNA methylation level at the promoter region of *CYP2E1* in a US birth cohort. The findings suggest that DNA methylation of *CYP2E1* may be an important regulator of the potential effects of maternal acetaminophen use on newborns.
