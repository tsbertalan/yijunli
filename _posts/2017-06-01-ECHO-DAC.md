I worked as a biostatistician from 2017 to 2019 at the the Data Analysis Center for the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes [(ECHO) Program](https://echochildren.org/) . My work contributed to the full development of the ECHO program in data harmonization, protocol development, and study operationalization during its initial phase.

My work also resulted in two co-authored publications.
