Led an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to investigate the associations between infant blood DNA methylation and later outcomes of recurrent wheezing and childhood asthma in a multi-center clinical cohort of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis.
<!--more-->
- Identified 61 novel differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with recurrent wheezing or asthma.
- Conducted deconvolution to identify cell-type specific effects underlying the DMRs; replicated the findings in isolated eosinophils. 
- Characterized the molecular network between the DMRs and 364 inflammatory and immune-related proteins to improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying asthma development.
- Leveraged external resources, including UK biobank, STRING, ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomic, and CATlas, to further improve the interpretation of the findings.
- Designed and executed data quality control pipelines for Illumina methylation arrays data and Olink proteomics data.
