Led an EWAS meta-analysis to evaluate the associations between DNA methylation at birth and childhood asthma in a diverse population.
- Analyzed data from 5 pediatric cohorts in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program [https://echochildren.org/], the largest child health research consortium in the United States. 
- Identified methylation differences associated with asthma including novel differentially methylated regions in the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) regions. ![[../assets/Figure4_EWAS_ECHO.jpg]]
- Investigated the heterogenous effects of DNA methylation on childhood asthma between sex.
- The first study to investigate epigenome-wide differential DNA methylation associated with childhood asthma among infants who were born before 28 weeks of gestation (i.e., extremely preterm).
